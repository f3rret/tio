“Fascist” can be understood as any group or individual who promotes the
political ideology of fascism.

“Fascism” can be broken down into 11 ideological features as well as 8 tactics
that can form a fascist system in varying combinations for the sake of
simplicity and brevity. The licensee will be considered fascist for the purposes
of this license if the licenser determines they meet at least 5 features or
tactics or a combination of the two.



IDEOLOGICAL FEATURES OF FASCISM

1. Hyper-nationalism

    Defined as “The belief in the superiority of one’s nation and of the
    paramount importance of advancing it.”

2. Militarism

    Defined as “Advocating for an increase in military forces beyond what
    the real defence of a nation needs, more influence of the military upon the
    policies of the civilian government, and a preference for force as a
    solution over diplomacy for problems.”

3. Glorification of violence and readiness to use it in politics

    Defined as “The belief that violence can be used to cleanse a tarnished
    nation, also by using violence to harm, intimidate or kill political
    opponents.”

4. Fetishisation of youth

    Defined as “Extolling the virtues of youth and making a special appeal to
    young people to join a cause or organisation.”

5. Fetishisation of masculinity

    Defined as “Extolling the virtues of male authority or patriarchy and
    making a special appeal to men to be leaders of households and groups.”

6. Leader cult

    Defined as “Creating an idealised, heroic, and worshipful image of a
    leader, often through unquestioning flattery and praise.”

7. Lost-golden-age syndrome

    Defined as “Creating or promoting the idea that a nation had a lost or
    stolen golden age in the past that must be returned to.”

8. Self-definition by opposition

    Defined as “Creating or promoting the idea that the group or individual is
    the only entity that can fight real or imagined evils within a society.”

9. Mass mobilisation and mass party

    Defined as “Creating or promoting the creation of a populist group or
    party for the advancement of fascist tactics or features.”

10. Hierarchical party structure and tendency to purge the disloyal

    Defined as “Removal of membership from a group for lacking absolute
    loyalty or lacking further usefulness to the group. Also having a
    hierarchical structure within the group itself.”

11. Theatricality

    Defined as “Using spectacle to gain and keep the attention of those
    inside and outside of the group using speeches full of absolutes and or
    superlatives. Elaborate collective rituals (rallies) meant to reinforce
    loyalty within the group.”



FASCIST TACTICS

1. Persecution of national minorities.
2. Persecution of racial minorities.
3. Persecution of religious minorities (Anti-Semitism, Islamophobia and others).
4. Promotion of a type of national purity.
5. Promotion of a state run by ideologically oriented corporate bodies.
6. Persecution of gender or sexual minorities.
7. Persecution of the disabled.

SPECIAL CRITERIA

Meeting only one of the following special criteria is enough to consider an
individual or group to be fascist for the purposes of this licence.

1. Promotion of any theories that state members of the Jewish ethnicity or
   faith control or largely control the world, finance, or other global major
   power system.

2. Denial of the Holocaust or any other historically proven genocide.

3. Promotion of ethnostates or apartheid states.

4. Advocating for eugenics. Either positive or negative eugenics. Promotion for
   the rights of abortion are not considered eugenics.

5. Advocating for the removal or denial of rights or legal protections from a
   class or group of people.



FORMER FASCISTS

People or organisations who used to promote the political ideology of fascism
but no longer do so must meet the following criteria to be able to use this
software.

1. Publicly disavow past fascist deeds and ideologies.

2. Expose any and all known fascists and former allies to the public.
   A suggested route would be through the one peoples project (onepeoplesproject.com).
   If they can confirm you have done so that will count as meeting condition two.

3. Publicly destroy any and all fascist paraphernalia you have in your
   possession including removal of tattoos and body markings affiliated with
   fascist groups or gangs.

If you need help escaping a fascist group, there are organisations that can
help you such as Life After Hate (lifeafterhate.org).
